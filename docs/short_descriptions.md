# Short Description Style Guide

A **short description** (1–2 sentences, ≤72 chars) should:

1. Be one physical line (no `\n`).
2. Start with an imperative-mood verb (e.g. “Returns”, “Calculates”).
3. Never start with fillers like “This…”, “A…”, or “An…”.
4. End with a single trailing period.
5. Be ≤ 72 characters (including the period).

| `Calculates the total and logs it to console` | `Calculate and return the total price.`         |
