# ADR 1: Initial Architecture Decisions

## Status

Accepted and Implemented

## Context

We need to design a system that can generate and improve documentation using AI while maintaining high quality standards and allowing for extensibility. The system needs to handle:

1. AI-powered content generation
2. Multiple types of quality evaluations
3. Iterative improvement cycles
4. Integration with external services (OpenAI)
5. Extensible evaluation framework

## Decision

We have decided to implement:

1. **Pipeline Architecture with Agent**
   - Linear flow with feedback loops
   - Centralized agent for AI interactions
   - Clear separation between components
   - Modular design for easy extension

2. **Component Structure**
   ```
   doc-agent/
   ├── __main__.py       # Entry point
   ├── agent.py          # AI interaction management
   ├── pipeline.py       # Flow orchestration
   ├── agent_loop.py     # Improvement iterations
   ├── draft.py          # Content generation
   ├── tools.py          # Utilities
   ├── lint.py          # Linting
   ├── outline.py       # Document structure
   ├── publish.py       # Output handling
   ├── ingestion.py     # Input processing
   ├── evaluators/      # Quality assessment
   └── linters/        # Style checking
   ```

3. **Agent-Based Management**
   - Centralized AI interaction handling
   - Consistent conversation management
   - Structured improvement cycles
   - Context preservation

4. **Modular Components**
   - Independent, focused modules
   - Clear interfaces
   - Easy to extend
   - Simple to test

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Improved Organization**
   - Clear component responsibilities
   - Well-defined interfaces
   - Easy to understand flow
   - Maintainable structure

2. **Better AI Integration**
   - Centralized AI management
   - Consistent interaction patterns
   - Improved context handling
   - Efficient resource use

3. **Enhanced Extensibility**
   - Modular architecture
   - Easy to add components
   - Simple to modify
   - Clear extension points

### Negative

1. **Increased Complexity**
   - More components to manage
   - Additional coordination needed
   - More interfaces to maintain
   - Potential for confusion

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Pipeline overhead
   - Sequential processing
   - Multiple handoffs
   - State management

3. **Development Overhead**
   - More files to maintain
   - Additional documentation needed
   - Interface management
   - Testing complexity

## Mitigation Strategies

1. **Component Management**
   - Clear documentation
   - Strong interfaces
   - Comprehensive tests
   - Code standards

2. **Performance**
   - Efficient pipelines
   - Smart caching
   - Batch processing
   - Resource optimization

3. **Development**
   - Strong tooling
   - Clear guidelines
   - Automated testing
   - Regular reviews

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Simple Script Approach**
   - Too limited
   - Hard to extend
   - Poor maintainability
   - No clear structure

2. **Microservices**
   - Too complex
   - Deployment overhead
   - Communication complexity
   - Resource intensive

3. **Pure Event System**
   - Complex coordination
   - Hard to debug
   - State management issues
   - Less predictable
